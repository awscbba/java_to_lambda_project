# Project: Java in Lambda

## Description

The idea is to create a service or set of services that allow for one to send an email with the necessary information to all the people who have earned an AWS Credit in a User Group activity.

The AWS Credits can be stored in a database (to be defined). When an AWS Credit is awarded, it must be marked as unavailable, note the date it was used, the email address and name of the creditor.

The email should be sent using an account of the group, with the AWS Credit highlighted, and should include a thank you note for the participation and add links to our social networks.
